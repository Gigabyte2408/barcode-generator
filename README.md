# barcode-generator
Used predefined horizontal and vertical line functions to write a script that outputs an image of a unique barcode based on any 13 digits entered.
A project I worked on when learning python initially in college. As part of an optional project, we were told to make a barcode image generator based on user input.
Additional parameters included making sure the numbers also showed below the barcode. We were provided with some fundamental code such as code for creating a vertical or horizontal line.
The bulk of the work was targetted around translating the inputted numbers into a framework that outputs the correct image of a barecode afterwards.

Imported one file called graphics with the relevant precursor functions.
